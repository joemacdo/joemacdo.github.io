    CFFL Week 12 Picks
  </title>

  <h3> So here's the deal, this is less of a picks than a quick update about how this website came to be.
      I mean, let's be serious, I clearly suck at this so what is my opinion really worth? In case
      you haven't heard, there's a pandemic thing going on right now and it has impacted my flying schedule
      just a wee bit. So after a spring of uncertainty I discovered a program through the VA that would
      pay for my tuition to a coding bootcamp. Of course, the VA was out of money so I would need to wait for
      the new fiscal year (October 1). So I spent the summer preparing and building my skills to be able to
      gain admission to a program and also be able to actually complete it. Seemed like a great gig - learn a
      new skill that isn't going anywhere anytime soon, spend a couple years gaining experience while the
      airlines unfucked themselves, then have the skills/connections/experience to do consulting work on the
      side while re-becoming a professional pilot. I got into the program I wanted and am in the middle of week 5.
      I thought in addition to my class work, I would build this site for my picks to help build my skills.
      And now, here is this piece of shit website (much like my piece of shit season). Why such a POS you might ask?
      Well, the VA is already out of money - again! So I will be dropping out of the program leaving my education less than
      half complete - just like this website.
      <br>
      <br>
      Okay, so here's the deal. If you missed it, refresh the website and watch my image. It should slide to the middle
      and back again. This was one of my first coding iterations - a time delay, using HTML and CSS. Didn't seem like
      it would work for what I wanted. Next, you can try hovering over Fran; he should move towards
      the middle while hovering and back out when not hovering. After I decided my time delay wouldn't work, I went for this option.
      This also didn't seem like it was going to work so I abandoned that. My final attempt can be witnessed in the Munsch-Chops
      matchup. Click on the trophy between them and watch what happens. The idea is that after they met in the middle
      my chosen winner would remain with the trophy and the loser would disappear to be replaced by my pick write-up. As it sits now
      this was completed with some JavaScript and probably could've been completed with a little more. But fuck it, fuck it all.
      <br>
      <br>
      Now, slide your mouse over Jason and you can see a few different images drop down.
      The idea was to have a few images of each owner and let you pick your favorite image. You can also check out some
      options on Ghosty/Hayes Bus/Hayes/Jeffrey. This is also some basic HTML with a little more intricate CSS. I think I
      probably could have gotten it to work as desired with a little JavaScript, but once I found out I wasn't going to finish
      my class, I didn't pursue the finishing touches of code to allow you to actually select a different image. Of note, it
      is much easier to find goofy pics of some of you than others.
      <br>
      <br>
      It was a fun project to help me build skills when I thought I was going to be able to finish my class, but then I lost motivation.
      Sorry not sorry, you get a half-assed attempt. Maybe I'll fine tune it and build it up for another time if I keep not flying. In the
      meantime, I've got honey-do projects to get to and a beard to groom.
